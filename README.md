## üöÄ Features

### Dual Combat Modes
- **Tank Mode**: Classic armored vehicle combat with turret control
- **Ultra Mode**: Transform into a melee robot with energy sword attacks

### Advanced AI System
- **Enemy AI**: Intelligent pathfinding, collision avoidance, and tactical shooting
- **Friendly AI**: Allied tanks that assist in combat against enemies
- **Dynamic Respawning**: Fallen enemies respawn after delay to maintain challenge

### Immersive 3D Graphics
- **Detailed Tank Models**: Fully 3D rendered chassis, treads, turrets, and weapons
- **Dynamic Camera System**: Multiple camera modes including first-person and orbital views
- **Environmental Design**: Bounded arena with realistic wall collision detection

### Combat Mechanics
- **Weapon Overheating**: Realistic firing rate limitations with cooldown periods
- **Health System**: Damage tracking with visual feedback
- **Scoring System**: Point-based rewards for tactical gameplay
- **Dominance Victory**: Control center area to achieve alternative win condition

## üéØ Gameplay

### Objective
